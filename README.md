# Baby-care-product-analysis
This Excel project allows me to apply crucial analysis techniques for any organization boasting a comprehensive range of products. I leveraged Excel pivot tables and slicers to create a report that gives 360-degree visibility of business performance. Management needs this type of analysis to understand how different brands, package types, package sizes, and stock keeping units performed over time. This is an optimal way to track performance and monitor industry trends as a whole, allowing to drill down and uncover detailed insights at lower breakdown levels.  This Excel project will showcase my data preprocessing skills, as well as my proficiency when it comes to working with Excel pivot tables. I have worked with real-world FMCG data to obtain a well-structured report that gives flexibility to decision-makers, empowering them to scrutinize performance.
